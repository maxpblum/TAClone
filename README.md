TAClone
=======

An old project from 2006 (freshman year), cloning the video game Tetris Attack

To try it, run TetrisAttack.jar (no need to clone the whole repository) with Java runtime 6 or later. The goal is to line up three or more blocks of the same color vertically or horizontally, and never let the blocks hit the top of the screen. In the real game, hitting the top of the screen makes you lose; in my clone, you can keep playing.

In the real game, the most bonus points are awarded for long chain reactions, and smaller bonuses are awarded for "combos" (lining up more than three same-colored blocks with just one switch).

Controls
--------
Arrows: Move cursor
Enter/Return: Switch two blocks, or a block and an empty space
Spacebar: Destroy selected blocks (development tool; not a real part of the game)
